# smart-delivery-route-planner
Intelligent navigation and discovery platform for delivery services, integrating interactive maps, points of interest (POIs), and advanced route optimization to streamline delivery operations.


## Requirements of the Application
- Route map with Points of Interest (POI), including restaurants and (Home) Addresses
- Street map has to be up-to-date and free to use commercially
- Area of focus is Germany
- Efficient Shortest Path Computation
- User Position Tracking through GPS data
- Has to be easily integrable on mobile devices
- self-hosting

The common approach consists of using open data sources like OpenStreetMap, supplement it with data from private vendors and customize it using own team.

## So far
- Google Maps API (Placement) used for nearby-me query 
- Data Problem and what is required:
    - GPS location of user
    - geo data of establishments
    - Preview Image (Google Maps Rezensionen)
    - Google Maps rating
    - Addresse, Telefonnummer, Website, E-Mail, Kategorie-Tags (E.g. Einrichtung, Essen, Lieferung von Mahlzeiten, Sehensw체rdigkeit, health)
- Aktuelle M채ngel:
    - Google Tags zu ungenau (Hotel, Care, Clinic)
    - Too many API requests, more caching and own db utilization needed
    - Category Filtering does not deliver result (maybe because of opening hours, but no feedback is given)




#### Glossary
- **Geocoding**: Process of converting address or place name to geographic coordinates
- **Reverse Geocoding**: Process of converting a location as described by geographic coordinates to a human-readable address or place name
- **Coordinate Formats**: 
    - Decimal degrees (DD): 41.40338, 2.17403;
    - Degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS): 41째24'12.2"N 2째10'26.5"E
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Finding shortest route for a single vehicle visiting all locations once and returning to the origin.
- **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: Like TSP but with multiple vehicles, routes and additional constraints (vehicle capacity, delivery schedules etc.)
- **Tile Map Service (TMS)** : Specification providing access to cartographic maps of geo-referenced data. A tile map is a map displayed by joining many images or vector data files. Instead, Web Map Service (WMS) typically uses a single large image. Nowadays more and more vector tiles than raster formats are used.
- **GPX (GPS Exchange Format)** is an XML schema designed as a common GPS data format, containing waypoints, tracks and routes.
- **PBF (Protocol buffer Binary Format)** binary file format for osm data
